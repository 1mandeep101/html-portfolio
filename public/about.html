<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! I'm just someone who's diving into the world of web development one step at a time. This little project you're looking at is a part of that journey. It’s not perfect, not flashy, but it's real — and made with a mix of curiosity, trial-and-error, and a bunch of “why isn’t this working?!” moments.I started learning HTML recently, and this page is one of my practice runs. You’ll find things like a movie ranking page, a funny birthday invite, and a bunch of random bits here and there. I kept the tone light and playful, because let’s be honest — coding can get stressful, and a little humor helps.

<p>I started learning HTML recently, and this page is one of my practice runs. You’ll find things like a movie ranking page, a funny birthday invite, and a bunch of random bits here and there. I kept the tone light and playful, because let’s be honest — coding can get stressful, and a little humor helps.

I don’t come from a super techy background or anything. I'm just someone who enjoys learning new things, even if it means staring at a screen for hours wondering why one div is floating off into space. But every small success, every time something finally works, it feels worth it.
</p>

<p>Outside of this, I’m into music, movies, and doing absolutely nothing when I get the chance. I believe in keeping things simple, not overthinking too much, and just trying stuff — even if it’s messy. That's kind of the spirit behind this project: keep going, keep trying, and have a little fun along the way.

If you’ve read this far, thanks for sticking around. Hope you find something here that makes you smile, or at least think, “Hey, I could do this too.” Because honestly, you can.

</p>
